//! Version-range negotiation for the `initialize` handshake.
//!
//! The rules are SPEC-ME3 §8 (ME-3b row), quoted rather than paraphrased because
//! the test table below is asserted against them — and quoted AGAIN inline, next
//! to each group of cases, so that "these answers were not chosen by whoever
//! wrote the code" is something a reader can check here rather than take:
//!
//! > 双方各报区间 `[min,max]` 取交集，交集为空 → 握手失败并把两边区间都放进错误
//! > （`-32000` + `version_mismatch`），交集非空 → 选定唯一版本
//! > `min(模块.max, 内核.max)` 并在响应里回显，**内核不得回一个模块没声明支持的
//! > 版本**；模块**不报区间** → 视为不兼容，握手失败。
//!
//! Five rules, and the fifth is the one an implementation drifts on: a module
//! that declares NO range is incompatible, not "assume v1". Treating silence as
//! agreement is the same failure shape as a lease-less credential downgrade —
//! a missing declaration answered with a default instead of a refusal.
//!
//! # This module has no production caller yet
//!
//! Its consumer is ME-3b-2b (the `initialize` wire shape), which in turn needs
//! ME-3b-1 (framing). So this is 🟢 library-only in the sense SPEC-MD-ME defines,
//! and it must not be recorded as ✅ anywhere.
//!
//! **The condition for removing it from `main` is an EVENT, not a date**: if
//! 3b-2b is abandoned or routed around — if something other than this function
//! ends up deciding the handshake's version — this file leaves with it. A
//! deadline in days would be a clock running against work two slices away, so it
//! would fire for a scheduling reason rather than for the reason this expiry
//! exists (the code was orphaned). An expiry that fires for the wrong reason gets
//! extended, and after one extension it is no longer an expiry, it is a comment.
//! The `TEMPORARY` marker in `agent24-os-packages` had force precisely because
//! the day it fired, its condition was genuinely met.
//!
//! See `stub` below for the call site that consumer is expected to use.
